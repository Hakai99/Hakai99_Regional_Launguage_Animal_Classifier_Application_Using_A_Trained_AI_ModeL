An intelligent, real-time animal detection Android application built with TensorFlow Lite and YOLOv8, featuring Assamese language support and text-to-speech functionality for educational purposes.

##Features

- Real-Time Animal Detection**: Uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 nano model to detect 11 different Assamese animals in real-time through your device's camera
- Assamese Language Support**: Complete Assamese interface with all text, labels, and speech output in Assamese script
- Text-to-Speech Integration**: Automatic pronunciation of detected animals in Assamese using Android's built-in TTS engine
- Offline Functionality**: Works completely offline - no internet connection required for detection
- Lightweight & Fast**: Optimized TensorFlow Lite model ensures smooth performance even on budget devices
- Kid-Friendly Interface**: Colorful, intuitive UI designed specifically for children to explore and learn about animals
